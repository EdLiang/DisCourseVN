                    Hiya, it’s been a while… or not. It might seem weird that I’m writing you a letter given that we are seeing each other and hanging out almost every day, but there’s always some stuffs that’re hard to say precisely because of that. This is not a prank, so don’t just toss this out, ‘kay? Otherwise you will be through a world of pain tomorrow at the arcade.

                    It’s been like, 3 years(?) or so since we got to know each other. Do you remember when Megan first introduced us to each other, you gave such a fierce leer at me, practically shouting out ‘get away from Megan’ voicelessly? It really wasn’t that hard to figure out how deeply in love you were with my childhood friend back then, and I was actually quite relieved when you two started going out with each other later on.
                    - Your buddy
